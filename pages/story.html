                    <p class=text>Ok, I'm going to be real with you. I'm super scared to do this. Putting my story out for everyone to see is hard for me to do. My experiences are sacred to me, and I'm still a relatively insecure person, so trying to share my experiences is making me feel way more vulnerable than I expected. Sharing with a close friend is one thing; sharing with the internet is a whole different ball game. So why am I choosing to share? Because I believe that people need to hear the experiences of other normal people like them being converted to Christ and living His gospel. I believe that we need the stories of others to inspire us and give us ideas on how to move forward on our journey. I don't think my challenges in being a believer are unique; I expect that there are many out there who can relate to the doubts and insecurities I deal with. It is for those people that I am writing. I hope that what I write will find its way to someone who can relate with my experience, and that hearing my experiences will give her or him the faith needed to trust God and come to know Him.</p>
                    <p class=text>So over the next few posts, I will be sharing my story as a believer. This story will give an overview of why I believe and my journey to develop faith and overcome doubt. Along the way I might occasionally deviate from the story to write posts that provide some background about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints that will be necessary for the story to make sense to those unfamiliar with our beliefs and culture.</p>
                    <p class=text>Thanks for coming to my site! I hope you check back regularly and follow my posts. More importantly, I hope they are of benefit to you. And if they're not, feel free to share them with a friend whom you think could use them!</p>
