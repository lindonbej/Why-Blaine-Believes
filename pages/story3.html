                <p class=text>As I got older, I had a number of significant spiritual experiences. Through these experiences, I came to know God for myself and began developing my own, independent belief in the teachings of Jesus Christ and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Spiritual experiences are difficult to describe to people who haven't had them (or at least haven't recognized them as such). Its a lot like trying to describe the flavor of salt to someone who hasn't tasted it before. When I share my spiritual experiences, I don't expect you to necessarily understand them, because understanding might require having a similar experience. But I do ask you to acknowledge that, for me, these experiences were very real, even if I can't recreate them for you. I have no scientific proof that these experiences happened or that they were truly from God, but in the moment of these experiences, there was no doubt in my mind that I was connecting with God. These experiences brought me profound joy and comfort, and I have chosen to continue to believe in these experiences now that I am older. In future posts I will discuss more about how I came to make that choice, but for now I would like to share with you one of these experiences. This experience is very sacred to me, and I hope that you will read it with an open mind and an open heart.</p>
                <p class=text>The first time I had a major spiritual experience was when I was about 12 or 13. Many congregations of the Church hold weekly activities for teenagers, and during one month the activities for my local congregation were all themed around missionary work. We called it Missionary Month, and the purpose was to help us prepare to be volunteer missionaries for the Church when we got older. For one of the activites, we got into groups of three and visited the homes of various families who were in our congregation. We ate dinner with them and listened to their experiences of being volunteer missionaries when they were younger (in my case, this included teaching us how to drink hot chocolate through a Tim Tam, which is delicious). Afterward, we practiced teaching them a missionary lesson.</p>
                <p class=text>The lesson that we had prepared to share with this family was on the Restoration and Joseph Smith's First Vision. As we got to the end of the lesson, the thought came to me that I should share my testimony of the First Vision with this family, because I knew that bearing personal testimony is an important part of teaching spiritual truths. But I had a problem: I didn't have a testimony of the First Vision. I believed in it, because I trusted my family and my church leaders, but I didn't have a personal conviction that it was true. However, despite this, I felt that I still needed to share my testimony of the First Vision. And so I opened my mouth and began to tell the family we were with that I knew that Joseph Smith had seen Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. As I spoke, a marvelous feeling came over me. It was unlike anything I had ever felt before. It wasn't an emotion, in that it didn't seem to come from within; rather, it felt like it came down from above me and enveloped the whole room. It made me feel wonderful, and in that moment I knew that I was having an experience with God; I knew that the Holy Spirit was testifying to me that Joseph Smith HAD seen God and Jesus Christ.</p>
                <p class=text>That experience was the beginning of my personal testimony. Numerous experiences, both large and small, have contributed to my belief in God and Jesus Christ's Restored Church since then, but I look back to that experience as my first major experience with God. That experience taught me that to experience God, we must act in faith despite our uncertainty.</p>
