                    <h3 class=subtitle>Teenage Years - Science and Faith</h3>
                <p class=text>Since I was young, I have had a great interest in science and math. My favorite show as a kid was Nova Science Now, and one of the best Christmas gifts I ever received was The Idiot's Guide to String Theory. </p>
                <p class=text>My love of science began in elementary school. In 4th grade science class, we learned about the water cycle, how water evaporates and rises from the earth, and then later rains back down. The water cycle was all fine and good, but I had a question that was not being addressed in that class's curriculum: why does water evaporate? The answer came a year later when we learned about atoms. We learned how all things are made of atoms, and in liquids those atoms move around close to each other, but when they heat up, they spread apart, and the liquid becomes a gas. That was my first "aha!" moment regarding science, and it had a profound impact on me. From then on, I always had a deep interest in understanding why things worked the way they did, in learning the mechanics happening underneath the things we observe. Science also appealed to me because the scientific method allowed us to learn truth in a way that was logical and consistent. Science felt reliable to me, and I liked that. Math appealed to me for similar reasons. It was logical, and not only was it logical, but it was also absolute. Things could be proven with total certainty in math, which again felt reliable to me, and I liked that. What's more, I believed strongly in the ability of the scientific method to discover truth.</p>
                <p class=text>However, in my teenage years, my love of science, logic and math posed a challenge to my faith. The first major experience that I remember dealing with this challenge came after reading a book about physics. It was a wonderful book, but in the appendix, there was a section containing the author's thoughts on science and the existence of God. In this appendix, he listed several things that people had previously offered as evidence for God's existence, and then refuted each one, explaining why those evidences weren't logically sound, were unscientific, etc</p>
                <p class=text>This was the first time that I can remember where I had to face the fact that logic and scientific reasoning didn't necessarily point to God. This was difficult for me to come to terms with, since I sincerely believed in God, and I sincerely believed in logic and science. In the moment, it was truly a crisis. My belief in God was such an integral part of who I was, and suddenly I felt like I had a responsibility to question or disregard that in order to be true to my belief in logic and reason. Two central parts of my identity were suddenly at odds with each other, and I didn't know how to cope.</p>
                <p class=text>I remember lying on my bed that afternoon, filled with dread, not knowing what to do. I desperately turned on some religious music in the hope that it would make me have a spiritual experience to cast away my doubt. But that didn't happen, and I just lay there with my anxiety. But the worst part was that I felt like a coward. Because even as I lay there, doubting God, I knew deep down that I wasn't about leave the church or give up my religion. I felt like even if I knew that God did not exist, I did not have the courage to change my life and challenge the traditions I grew up with.</p>
                <p class=text>Eventually, the dread and immediate anxiety went away, and I continued forward with life. But from then on, there were always questions in the back of my mind that I knew needed to be addressed: How do I reconcile my belief in God and my belief in science? How do I know with certainty that God is real? What do I do if I decide that God isn't real?</p>
                <p class=text>But these questions and doubts did not stop me from acting in faith and living the gospel. For one thing, living the gospel was the default in my family and community, so when I was unsure of what to do, I would simply keep on going. But beyond that, throughout my teenage years I continued to have wonderful spiritual experiences that reaffirmed my belief in God.</p>
                <p class=text>Some of these were small and simple experiences, like the feeling of warmth and happiness I had while studying the scriptures or attending church or seminary. Others were more major experiences, where I felt that God was communicating with me. Through these experiences, I learned that God loved me, that He was watching over me, that He listened to my prayers, and that I could be forgiven of my sins by the grace of Jesus Christ. Collectively, these experiences constituted my testimony, the reason I believed in God.</p>
                <p class=text>A final thing that helped me was a line from the Book of Mormon that was my favorite scripture quote during much of my teenage years: "faith is things which are hoped for and not seen; wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith" (Ether 12:6). When I read this scripture, I would understand it as, "dispute not because ye have no scientific evidence yet." This line of scripture reminded me that having my faith challenged was part of the process. I could look back on past spiritual experiences as witnesses I had received, and that gave me the hope to keep believing until the next witness came.</p>
                <p class=text>And so I continued to live with two parts of myself: the agnostic, who resolutely held to the fact that I still didn't have proof of my beliefs; and the believer, who had devout faith in and love for God. Throughout all of this, I chose to live according to my faith, not my doubts. I continued to pray, study the scriptures, and attend church services. I tried, although imperfectly, to follow the teachings of Jesus Christ and His Church.</p>
                <p class=text>And I waited for a day when I would know with certainty whether the gospel of Jesus Christ was true.</p>
