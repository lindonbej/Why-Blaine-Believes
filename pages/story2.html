                    <h3 class=subtitle>Beginnings of Faith</h3>
                    <p class=text>I was born into a family that has a long heritage of faith in Jesus Christ and membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Several of my ancestors joined the Church in its early days and some knew Joseph Smith personally.</p>
                    <p class=text>I grew up participating actively in the Church. Each evening, my family knelt together to pray, and many mornings we would study the scriptures while we ate breakfast together. Each Sunday my parents took us to church, and I attended weekly youth activities organized by the church. I also lived in an area where most of my neighbors and schoolmates were also members of the Church. Because of this background, living the restored gospel of Jesus Christ has always been a defining part of who I am.</p>
                    <p class=text>In the Church, individuals can be baptized starting at age 8, and most children who are raised in the Church are baptized soon after their 8th birthday. This was the case for me as well. I don't remember much from the day of my baptism, although I do remember it being a happy experience. What stands out to me about my baptism was what led up to it. I remember as my 8th birthday approached, my parents discussed with me the upcoming opportunity to be baptized and expressed their desire for me to be baptized. But my father made it very clear to me the the decision to get baptized was my decision and not theirs, and that I could choose whether to go forward with it or not. Even as an eight-year-old, I was impressed by this notion of choice and agency. Later during the school year, a friend of mine asked me whether I thought she should be baptized, and my response was that what I thought didn't really matter since getting baptized was a choice that she needed to make (although I did give it as my personal opinion that she should get baptized).</p>
                    <p class=text>As an 8-year-old, my faith in Jesus Christ was still largely based on the innoccent acceptance of what my parents and Sunday School teachers taught me. It wasn't until later that I came to develop my own, independent belief in Jesus Christ. But the choice to be baptized was my own, and I made that choice with what knowledge and experience I had at the time. I am grateful to my parents for the way they approached my baptism, because it set a precedent in my life of having the freedom to make my own decisions with regard to my spirituality. Later in my life this notion of freedom would be a crucial element in my journey of faith.</p>
                    <p class=text>I have spoken to individuals who believe that decisions such as baptism should not be made until adulthood. To a large extent, I am sympathetic to this belief. I certainly didn't fully understand what I was getting myself into when I committed to follow Jesus Christ as an 8-year-old, and it seems reasonable for such a big decision to not be made until one has a full grasp of its implications. But as I have walked along my journey of faith, I have realized that there will always be uncertainty and ambiguity in life. We will never have a full grasp of the implications of our decisions, especially in spiritual matters. An important part of our spiritual development is learning to make the best decision we can with what experiences God has given us, even though those experiences may leave some questions unanswered. Coming to this understanding has taken most of my 23 years of living. At multiple times I have made difficult spiritual decisions with imperfect information, but in each case, God has guided me and ultimately confirmed to me that I am on the right path. I testify that God is there and He loves us and desires us to come to know Him. All of our journeys to know God are different, but He is guiding each of us on our respective journeys, even when we don't recognize it. I testify of this in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen!</p>
